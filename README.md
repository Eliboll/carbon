# Car-bon

#### Car-bon is an application that allows users to log the amount of CO2 that their vehicle emissions take. 

This project allows users to add trips by selecting their vehicle, then pulling CO2 emissions from a backend based on that vehicle. The data will then be stored in a history section that is logged with the backend.

This project was built using a front-end based around react native, and a backend using flask to store a custom database.
